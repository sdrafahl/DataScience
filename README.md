# Data Science

This repository will hold some data science tools I am writing in Python.

## Getting Started

You will need pip to install some packages.

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo pip install matplotlib

sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

sudo apt-get install python-tk

```

After all the packages are install you can now run the project.

```
python main.py

```

This will run the demo of the classes and tools that are created.
